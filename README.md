<p>Welcome to my Python Development Internship Repository!</p>
<p>Hi there! I'm excited to share the projects I've been working on during my internship at Cognorise Infotech.</p>
This repository contains the code for three Python projects I developed:

Simple Calculator
Hangman Game
Random Password Generator

**Table of Contents**
1. Simple Calculator
2. Hangman Game
3. Random Password Generator

**1. Simple Calculator**
This project is a basic calculator that performs simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input two numbers and select the desired operation.

**Features:**
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Input validation to handle errors gracefully 

**Usage:**
  To use the calculator, run the following command:

**Copy code:**
  python calculator.py

**2. Hangman Game**
The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This project helps to demonstrate the use of loops, conditionals, and string manipulation in Python.

**Features**
- Random word selection from a predefined list
- Display of guessed and remaining letters
- Limited number of guesses

**Usage:**
  To play the Hangman game, run the following command:

**Copy code:**
  python hangman.py

**3. Random Password Generator**
This project generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length and the inclusion of special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters. It showcases the use of randomization and string handling in Python.

**Features**
- Customizable password length
- Option to include special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters
