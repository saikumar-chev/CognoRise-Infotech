Welcome to my Python Development Internship Repository!
Hi there! I'm excited to share the projects I've been working on during my internship at Cognorise Infotech. This repository contains the code for three Python projects I developed:

Simple Calculator
Hangman Game
Random Password Generator
Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or contribute!

Table of Contents
1. Simple Calculator
2. Hangman Game
3. Random Password Generator

Simple Calculator
This project is a basic calculator that performs simple arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input two numbers and select the desired operation.

Features
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Input validation to handle errors gracefully
Usage
To use the calculator, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python calculator.py
Hangman Game
The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This project helps to demonstrate the use of loops, conditionals, and string manipulation in Python.

Features
Random word selection from a predefined list
Display of guessed and remaining letters
Limited number of guesses
Usage
To play the Hangman game, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python hangman.py
Random Password Generator
This project generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length and the inclusion of special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters. It showcases the use of randomization and string handling in Python.

Features
Customizable password length
Option to include special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters
